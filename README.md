Projrct with 3 parts.
In the first part of project we take the data about appartments for rent in Tel-Aviv form https://www.ad.co.il/nadlanrent?sp275=17413  
Data from 4 neighborhoods(103 appartments) transfered to table (csv) with specific variables.
Neighborhoods are: "Kohav hacafon" (15), "Ganei hacaala" (6) and "Hacafon hayashan hahelek hamercazi" (64) "Yad Eliyahu" (18). Two last were added because we want 100 appartments.
